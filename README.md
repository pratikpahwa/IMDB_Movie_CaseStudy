We tried to find some interesting insights into a few movies released between 1916 and 2016, using Python. 
We have downloaded a movie dataset, written a Python code to explore the data, gain insights into the movies, actors, directors, and collections.

Below are the steps I followed for analysis:

Task1: Reading and Inspection
1.1 Import & Read
1.2 Inspect the dataframe

Task2: Cleaning the data
2.1 Inspect null values
2.2 Drop unnecesary columns
2.3 Drop unecessary rows using columns with high Null percentages
2.4 Fill NaN values
2.5 Check the number of retained rows

Task3: Data Analysis
3.1 Change the unit of columns
3.2 Find the movies with highest profit
3.3 Drop duplicate values
3.4 Find IMBD Top50
3.5 Find the best directors
3.6 Find popular genres
3.7 Find the critic favorite and audience favorite actors
